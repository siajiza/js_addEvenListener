# **AddEvenListener**

One of the most popular features of Javascript, is how we can implement dynamic behavior in to our app or website.

We can find this "dynamic behavior" using a Javascript function named "addEvenListener" where we call some behavior where we for example can pass in the pointer on the text or click on it and we create some "dynamic behavior".
